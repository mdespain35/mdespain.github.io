            <h3>Alignment</h3>
            <p>ESPN</p>
            <a href="espn.com">espn.com</a>
            <br/>
            <img src="#" alt="ESPN mobile home page screenshot"/>
            <p>This website is a great example of alignment because there
                are a lot of items that need to be displayed, and they are
                categorically placed together(various sports leagues) in a 
                visually pleasing way.  Everything is aligned in a way that
                makes the page look organized rather than cluttered.

            <h3>Visual Hierarchy</h3>
            <p>Wizards of the Coast</p>
            <a href="https://company.wizards.com/en">company.wizards.com</a>
            <br/>
            <img src="#" alt="WotC mobile home page screenshot"/>
            <p>This website is a great example of visual hierarchy because
                right off the rip, you see a massive interactive image as a
                banner which advertises a product that the company wants to 
                emphasize as well as links to see more.

            <h3>White Space and Clean Design</h3>
            <p>Vouch Insurance</p>
            <a href="https://vouch.com">vouch.com</a>
            <img src="#" alt="Vouch Insurance mobile home page screenshot"/>
            <br/>
            <p>This website is a great example of white space and clean design
                because it has a simple design that flows well and does not have 
                much in terms of items, but doesn't feel empty. The design matches 
                what the company tries to do which is simplify business insurance 
                and it comes through on their page brilliantly.
